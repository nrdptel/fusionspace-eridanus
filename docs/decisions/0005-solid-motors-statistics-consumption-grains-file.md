# ADR-005: Solid motors: statistics, consumption, grains, file models and the bundled catalog (2026-09-17)

- **Status:** accepted; the peak thrust and burn-time crossings refined by ADR-150 (delivered samples only)
- **Summary:** Solid motors: statistics, consumption, grains, file models and the bundled catalog

**Context.** M1.3 builds `hpr-motor`. Loft's motor code went wrong in eight ways (lessons L36–L43):
one `.eng` block per file, lost delay markers, class letters off at band tops, the last sample as
burn time, a fixed midpoint CG with no inertia, unlicensed curves, loose impulse checks, and
header envelopes trusted over catalog data. RocketPy, the M2.1 oracle, has its own conventions.
Several choices had no single right answer (`docs/physics/motor.md`).

**Decision.**

- **Statistics:** total impulse integrates the straight-line curve exactly, from an implicit
  `(0, 0)`. Burn time follows NFPA 1125: between the 5%-of-peak crossings. Average thrust is total
  impulse over that burn time. This is ThrustCurve's glossary and its site code, which a committed
  fixture runs unchanged (hpr agrees to 1.8e-15 on the bundle); its statistics page words average
  thrust differently, and the difference is about 0.1% of impulse.
- **Impulse classes:** upper limits are inclusive (NAR: "5.01 to 10.0 N-sec" for `C`), from
  `1/8A` to `O`, and on to `Z` by doubling.
- **Consumption:** constant effective exhaust velocity, `m_p(t) = m_p0 (1 − I(t)/I)`. This is
  RocketPy's `SolidMotor` and ThrustCurve's `.rse` mass columns. It is an approximation (NASA
  SP-8039 shows `I_sp` drifting within a burn), recorded as such.
- **Propellant layout:** a fixed-shape column (the default, RocketPy's `GenericMotor` model) or
  BATES grains. The grain regression is solved exactly in burned mass instead of RocketPy's ODE in
  time. Motor mass and inertias agree with RocketPy within 7.9e-5 relative, and the centre of
  mass within 5.8e-6 of the motor length.
- **Envelope default:** from a catalog entry alone, the propellant is a solid column and the dry
  mass a thin tube, both over the full length and centred. Crude, and documented as such; motors
  with data use `SolidMotor::new`. Catalog metadata overrides the curve file's header.
- **Steps:** equal consecutive times in a curve are a step, not an error; decreasing times,
  negative thrust, and curves with no impulse or no NFPA burn time are errors. ThrustCurve's code
  instead averages points under 50 µs apart: identical on every bundled curve, and up to 1.1% in
  average thrust on 17 of 1710 survey files, all with repeated times.
- **Grains** need a bore: a solid end burner isn't a BATES grain, and its regression differs.
- **Ambient pressure:** the full-flow term `(p_ref − p_a) A_e` applies strictly inside the burn,
  as in RocketPy's flight, and only where the curve's thrust is positive. `p_ref`, the test site's
  pressure, is stored with the nozzle, since files don't record it. The term steps in after
  ignition and to zero at burnout, and overstates tail-off thrust (about 1% of
  impulse in vacuum for a 38 mm reload with a known exit); COTS data gives no exit diameter, so
  it is off by default.
- **File models:** `.eng` and `.rse` keep the file's units and points exactly, so read-write-read
  cycles are bit-exact. Readers are lenient and return warnings; writers refuse anything the
  reader would read differently. Readers take `&str`; decoding bytes is `hpr-io`'s job.
- **Delays:** the raw string is kept; `P`, `100` and `1000` read as plugged, and `0` reads as its
  own ambiguous "zero or plugged" setting, never as an ejection at burnout.
- **Curve end:** the thrust is zero from the last sample's instant on, so thrust, mass flow and
  propellant agree at burnout. The motor's dry mass must be positive.
- **Bundled catalog:** only curves ThrustCurve marks public domain, whose total impulse, burn time
  and average thrust each match ThrustCurve's stored values within 1%. That is 32 curves from B to
  O. Of 554 public-domain curves, 196 pass, so the rule leaves out 358. Most miss on burn time or
  average thrust, or their impulse is 1–5% off; the breakdown is in
  `docs/research/thrustcurve-data.md`. "Free" curves (which can be GPL) are never bundled.
- **Catalog metadata:** each bundled motor's published statistics and identifiers (names, class,
  type, dimensions, masses, impulse, thrust, burn time, delays, case) are copied from
  ThrustCurve's API into the committed index, with attribution. ThrustCurve states no terms for
  its metadata. These are facts about commercial products, mostly from certification bodies, for
  32 motors, and the milestone's 1% check and offline catalog need them. Neer confirmed on
  2026-09-18 that they are treated as facts, used with attribution; the catalog keeps them all.
- **XML:** `roxmltree`, a strict read-only parser that refuses DTDs; the `.rse` writer is
  hand-written.

**Consequences.**

- M1.4 places the motor's nozzle exit in the body frame and adds retainers with
  `with_added_dry_mass`.
- M1.6 takes mass, centre, inertias and `ṁ` from `SolidMotor::state`, and decides whether to
  apply the ambient-pressure thrust term (COTS files give no exit diameter).
- M2.1 feeds RocketPy only curves without an explicit `(0, 0)`: RocketPy prepends one, and the
  duplicate makes its impulse NaN. RocketPy's `GenericMotor.load_from_eng` uses the diameter as
  the chamber radius.
- M5 fetches the other curves into a cache and never bundles them.
